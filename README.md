### âš™ About the project
<img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1171520/screenshots/6540871/pokedex2.png" height=350><br>

The goal is to create an app similar to the Pokedex, the famous device from the PokÃ©mon anime. The design was inspired by a model found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6540871-Pokedex-App). To develop this project, in addition to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided by an expert, the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) was also used. This API offers a variety of information about PokÃ©mon through a URL: ```https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/<numero do pokemon>```.
